This project is a  weather dashboard online responsive website. You can check the weather of any city on the world  by entering the name and click on a button , or you can check some of the predefined buttons.

It also gives a forecast of five days weather, it displays: date, temperature, humidit and  wind speed  . 
It has a detail, it just shows the forecast until you click these buttons twice, I couldnt find the solution. :P

There are many upgrades that could be done,  a screenshot of the webiste is available on the assets folder
