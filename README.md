This project is a  weather dashboard online responsive website. You can check the weather of any city on the world  by entering the name and click on a button , or you can check some of the predefined buttons.

It also gives a forecast of five days of weather, it displays date, temperature, humidity and  wind speed . 
It has a detail, it just shows the forecast until you click these buttons twice, I couldn't find the solution. :P

There are many upgrades that could be done,  a screenshot of the website is available in the assets folder.
